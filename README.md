# p2p Babysitter

Because someone has to make sure everyone is playing nice.

This service is built to fill any gaps someone coming from a client-server architecture to a p2p one might not like. It maintains central control and moderation while enabling the benefits of direct communication that isn't totally reliant on a remote server.

So far it consists of:

1. login, logout, and key refresh functionality

- login with username and password
- logout will revoke tokens
- key refresh will revoke and reissue tokens

2. jwt tokens containing client's public key and identifying information for peers to prove identities

- identifying information is customizable
- key pair must be generated by client

3. cookie based sessions stored in redis

- this gives us security to the server with a token that cannot be accessed through scripts

4. endpoint to establish shared secrets between parties

- this is for forward security so that after the quantum crypto-apocalypse we only leak our secrets to the NSA and China
